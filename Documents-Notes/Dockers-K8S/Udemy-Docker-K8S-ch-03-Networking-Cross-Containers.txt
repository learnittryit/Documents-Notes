1. Containers and Network access , how containers interact with each other .

Basically meaning [Container 2 - Main application] is communication to 4 api's
	Another Container -DB
	Direct interner www.website - third part API
	Local machine

Part 1 [Container 1 - SQL]  <----> [Container 2 - Main application] <--------> [Internet - www.interner]
Part 2 Also [Container 2 - Main application] <------> [with application on local host]

2. EITHER we provide the url , like we use rest template and url ,
	OR we allow docker to to make container networks
	
3. 
-----------------------------
Creating Container Networks
-----------------------------

|-----------------Network--------------------|
| [Container-1] [Container-2] [Container-3]	 |
|------------------------------------------- |

Point 1 - [Putting All containers in one network]
a.  we can add all the containers in one network by adding "--network my_network" ... in docker run
		> docker run --network my_network_name .... 
b.  so now all containers can talk to each other under one network , and docker manages it all. All ip lookup and other stuff docker
	does itself.No need to do manual ip lookup. I think more like Eureka Server which is handing it.

Point 2 - Instead of a normal run command , make changes in the basic command and add --network parameter
		> docker run --rm -d --name mongodb --network any_network_name_of_our_choice_its_just_an_identifier -p 3000:3000 image_name

	Important Concepts Starts
==============================
Point 3 - Very Very important : Unlike Volumes , docker will not create a network automatically for you
			2 important steps :
				a.) Create a network
				b.) Now use the network
	MOTA MOTA network banao and --netwok command docker run  mein de do

Important Learning -How network communicate with each other ?
	simply use the name of the container as a domain name in the url instead of localhost or ip address.
E.g 
	If not in same network :
		http://10.0.1.2:8080/my_url			
	If in same network :
		http://name_of_container:8080/my_url	

1. Docker communicate from container to local host by using special host.docker.internal address.
