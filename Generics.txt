Upperbound Wildcard =extends		List<? extends Number>  - list of numbers or its sub-types , like double,Integer,Long  etc
	[Upper Bound - means it will stay on top , so all sub types]

Bounded means restricted
Bounded wild cards. E.g
List<Buildings> - it will only accept buildings
List<? extends Building - it will accept Buildings and its sub types	, this is a bounded wild card
Actual Bounded means restricted and real example is 
	public <T> void test(List<T> t); - I have restricted that it can accept T only
	public <T extends Building> void test(T t) : Mein sirf T hi accept keronga
