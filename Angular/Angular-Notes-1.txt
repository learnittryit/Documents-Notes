1. JS framework
	create reactive SPA (Single Page Application)
2. Reactive means real time experience - JS changes the DOM
	Document Object Model(DOM) - we are only changing the currently loaded page
3. Angular JS is outdated  --
	Latest is = Angular .... just Angular
	
---------------
1. Angular CLI


========================
	Basic Concepts
========================
1. Node JS is needed for Angular	[Angular CLI uses is behind the scene]	
	npm = node package manager, to manage dependencies by angular
	Node JS is a superset language

2. Prerequisite is Node JS to install angular
Install node JS - 

•	Node.js v14.17.6 to /usr/local/bin/node
•	npm v6.14.15 to /usr/local/bin/npm
Make sure that /usr/local/bin is in your $PATH.	

3. Now node JS is installed now go to CLI and install angular , all commands are on website
https://angular.io/guide/setup-local
npm install -g @angular/cli@latest
-g = means globally
Now Angular is installed from node package manager repository and install it in your machine

4. Now Node JS and Angular both are installed.
	Choose a folder where Angular is needed
	
	s1- cd /folder
	s2- ng new my-first-app --no-strict
		> set Angular routing N 
		> CSS as default style sheets
	s3 - ng serve , this brings up the server
		By default it will run on the localhost:4200	

4.1 - Add css + make angular aware using config "angular.json"
	s4- Locally install bootstrap css , not globally as I amn not using -g
		>npm install --save bootstrap@3 	
		
	
Remember - we are using npm (Node Package Manager) for installations 
	-g for global
	without means project specific where the command is run and will store in nodes_modules folder. 
	But we need to make angular aware of this , How? Answer :update one of the config file	
	angular.json
	s4.1 - go to angular.json file --> see the styles entry--> copy the path and paste 
		"node_modules/bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap-theme.min.css"
	
5. "ng serve" will start an app on a particular port, but if you write "ng serve" again then it will run same app on another port
	E.g 
		First  > On terminal on mac I did > ng serve					localhost:4200
		Second > On terminal on Visual Studio Code I did > ng serve		localhost:4300
		Change reflects changes on both

Type Script
==============		
		
Type Script - 	Superset of JS e.g Type is a strong typing , writing time compiler checking
				It does not	work in browser , and hence is converted to JS in the end
